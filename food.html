            <h3> Sonadia Food </h3>
            <p>
                The food culture of Sonadia Island is deeply connected to its natural surroundings and the coastal
                lifestyle
                of the local community. Since it is a small island with limited infrastructure, the cuisine primarily
                reflects the simplicity and resourcefulness of the residents, relying heavily on fresh, locally sourced
                ingredients.
